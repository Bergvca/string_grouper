## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1?] - 2021-06-11

### Added

* Added new keyword argument **`tfidf_matrix_dtype`** (the datatype for the tf-idf values of the matrix components). Allowed values are `numpy.float32` and `numpy.float64` (used by the required external package `sparse_dot_topn` version 0.3.1).  Default is `numpy.float32`.  (Note: `numpy.float32` often leads to faster processing and a smaller memory footprint albeit less numerical precision than `numpy.float64`.)

### Changed

* Changed dependency on `sparse_dot_topn` from version 0.2.9 to 0.3.1
* Changed the default datatype for cosine similarities from numpy.float64 to numpy.float32 to boost computational performance at the expense of numerical precision.
* Changed the default value of the keyword argument `max_n_matches` from 20 to the number of strings in `duplicates` (or `master`, if `duplicates` is not given). 
* Changed warning issued when the condition \[`include_zeroes=True` and `min_similarity` &le; 0 and `max_n_matches` is not sufficiently high to capture all nonzero-similarity-matches\] is met to an exception. 
 
### Removed

* Removed the keyword argument `suppress_warning`

## [0.4.0] - 2021-04-11

### Added

* Added group representative functionality - by default the centroid is used. From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)
* Added string_grouper_utils package with additional group-representative functionality: 
    * new_group_rep_by_earliest_timestamp
    * new_group_rep_by_completeness
    * new_group_rep_by_highest_weight

    From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)    
* Original indices are now added by default to output of `group_similar_strings`, `match_most_similar` and `match_strings`.
  From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)
* `compute_pairwise_similarities` function From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner) 

### Changed

* Default group representative is now the centroid. Used to be the first string in the series belonging to a group.
  From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)
* Output of `match_most_similar` and `match_strings` is now a `pandas.DataFrame` object instead of a `pandas.Series`
by default. From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)
* Fixed a bug which occurs when min_similarity=0. From [@ParticularMiner](https://github.com/ParticularMiner)
