The SVG image displayed above is a visualization of one of the groups of strings determined by <samp>string_grouper</samp>.  

The ***centroid*** of the group (as determined by <samp>string_grouper</samp>) is the largest node, also with the most lines (edges) originating from it. A thick line in the image denotes a strong similarity between the nodes at its ends, while a faint thin line denotes weak similarity.

The image was designed using the graph-visualization software Gephi 0.9.2 with data generated by <samp>string_grouper</samp>.

**<samp>string_grouper</samp>** is a library that makes finding groups of similar strings within a single, or multiple, lists of strings easy — and fast. **<samp>string_grouper</samp>** uses **tf-idf** to calculate [**cosine similarities**](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-cosine-similarity-and-its-application-fd42f585296a) within a single list or between two lists of strings. The full process is described in the blog [Super Fast String Matching in Python](https://bergvca.github.io/2017/10/14/super-fast-string-matching.html).

## Installing

<samp>pip install string-grouper</samp>

## Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from string_grouper import match_strings, match_most_similar, \
	group_similar_strings, compute_pairwise_similarities, \
	StringGrouper
```

As shown above, the library may be used together with <samp>pandas</samp>, and contains four high level functions (<samp>match_strings</samp>, <samp>match_most_similar</samp>, <samp>group_similar_strings</samp>, and <samp>compute_pairwise_similarities</samp>) that can be used directly, and one class (<samp>StringGrouper</samp>) that allows for a more interactive approach. 

The permitted calling patterns of the four functions, and their return types, are:

| Function        | Parameters | <samp>pandas</samp> Return Type |
| -------------: |:-------------|:-----:|
| <samp>match_strings</samp>| <samp>(master, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>match_strings</samp>| <samp>(master, duplicates, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>match_strings</samp>| <samp>(master, master_id=id_series, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>match_strings</samp>| <samp>(master, duplicates, master_id, duplicates_id, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>match_most_similar</samp>| <samp>(master, duplicates, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>Series</samp> (if kwarg `ignore_index=True`) otherwise <samp>DataFrame</samp> (default)|
| <samp>match_most_similar</samp>| <samp>(master, duplicates, master_id, duplicates_id, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>group_similar_strings</samp>| <samp>(strings_to_group, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>Series</samp> (if kwarg `ignore_index=True`) otherwise <samp>DataFrame</samp> (default)|
| <samp>group_similar_strings</samp>| <samp>(strings_to_group, strings_id, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>DataFrame</samp> |
| <samp>compute_pairwise_similarities</samp>| <samp>(string_series_1, string_series_2, **kwargs)</samp>| <samp>Series</samp> |

In the rest of this document the names, <samp>Series</samp> and <samp>DataFrame</samp>, refer to the familiar <samp>pandas</samp> object types.

#### Functions:

* #### `match_strings` 
   Returns a <samp>DataFrame</samp> containing similarity-scores of all matching pairs of highly similar strings from <samp>master</samp> (and <samp>duplicates</samp> if given).  Each matching pair in the output appears in its own row/record consisting of
   
   1. its "left" part: a string (with/without its index-label) from <samp>master</samp>, 
   2. its similarity score, and  
   3. its "right" part: a string (with/without its index-label) from <samp>duplicates</samp> (or <samp>master</samp> if <samp>duplicates</samp> is not given), 
   
   in that order.  Thus the column-names of the output are a collection of three groups:
   
   1. The name of <samp>master</samp> and the name(s) of its index (or index-levels) all prefixed by the string `'left_'`,
   2. `'similarity'` whose column has the similarity-scores as values, and 
   3. The name of <samp>duplicates</samp> (or <samp>master</samp> if <samp>duplicates</samp> is not given) and the name(s) of its index (or index-levels) prefixed by the string `'right_'`.
   
   Indexes (or their levels) only appear when the keyword argument `ignore_index=False` (the default). (See [tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md](tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md) for a demonstration.)
   
   If either <samp>master</samp> or <samp>duplicates</samp> has no name, it assumes the name `'side'` which is then prefixed as described above.  Similarly, if any of the indexes (or index-levels) has no name it assumes its <samp>pandas</samp> default name (`'index'`, `'level_0'`, and so on) and is then prefixed as described above.
   
   In other words, if only parameter <samp>master</samp> is given, the function will return pairs of highly similar strings within <samp>master</samp>.  This can be seen as a self-join where both <samp>'left_'</samp> and <samp>'right_'</samp> prefixed columns come from <samp>master</samp>. If both parameters <samp>master</samp> and <samp>duplicates</samp> are given, it will return pairs of highly similar strings between <samp>master</samp> and <samp>duplicates</samp>. This can be seen as an inner-join where <samp>'left_'</samp> and <samp>'right_'</samp> prefixed columns come from <samp>master</samp> and <samp>duplicates</samp> respectively.     
   
   The function also supports optionally inputting IDs (<samp>master_id</samp> and <samp>duplicates_id</samp>) corresponding to the strings being matched.  In which case, the output includes two additional columns whose names are the names of these optional <samp>Series</samp> prefixed by <samp>'left_'</samp> and <samp>'right_'</samp> accordingly, and containing the IDs corresponding to the strings in the output.  If any of these <samp>Series</samp> has no name, then it assumes the name `'id'` and is then prefixed as described above.
   
   
* #### `match_most_similar` 
   If `ignore_index=True`, returns a <samp>Series</samp> of strings, where for each string in <samp>duplicates</samp> the most similar string in <samp>master</samp> is returned.  If there are no similar strings in <samp>master</samp> for a given string in <samp>duplicates</samp> (because there is no potential match where the cosine similarity is above the threshold \[default: 0.8\]) then the original string in <samp>duplicates</samp> is returned.  The output <samp>Series</samp> thus has the same length and index as <samp>duplicates</samp>.  
   
   For example, if an input <samp>Series</samp> with the values <samp>\['foooo', 'bar', 'baz'\]</samp> is passed as the argument <samp>master</samp>, and <samp>\['foooob', 'bar', 'new'\]</samp> as the values of the argument <samp>duplicates</samp>, the function will return a <samp>Series</samp> with values: <samp>\['foooo', 'bar', 'new'\]</samp>.
   
   The name of the output <samp>Series</samp> is the same as that of <samp>master</samp> prefixed with the string `'most_similar_'`.  If <samp>master</samp> has no name, it is assumed to have the name `'master'` before being prefixed.
       
   If `ignore_index=False` (the default), `match_most_similar` returns a <samp>DataFrame</samp> containing the same <samp>Series</samp> described above as one of its columns.  So it inherits the same index and length as <samp>duplicates</samp>.  The rest of its columns correspond to the index (or index-levels) of <samp>master</samp> and thus contain the index-labels of the most similar strings being output as values.  If there are no similar strings in <samp>master</samp> for a given string in <samp>duplicates</samp> then the value(s) assigned to this index-column(s) for that string is `NaN` by default.  However, if the keyword argument `replace_na=True`, then these `NaN` values are replaced with the index-label(s) of that string in <samp>duplicates</samp>.  Note that such replacements can only occur if the indexes of <samp>master</samp> and <samp>duplicates</samp> have the same number of levels.  (See [tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md](tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md#MMS) for a demonstration.)
   
   Each column-name of the output <samp>DataFrame</samp> has the same name as its corresponding column, index, or index-level of <samp>master</samp> prefixed with the string `'most_similar_'`.
  
   If both parameters <samp>master_id</samp> and <samp>duplicates_id</samp> are also given, then a <samp>DataFrame</samp> is always returned with the same column(s) as described above, but with an additional column containing those IDs from these input <samp>Series</samp> corresponding to the output strings.  This column's name is the same as that of <samp>master_id</samp> prefixed in the same way as described above.  If <samp>master_id</samp> has no name, it is assumed to have the name `'master_id'` before being prefixed.


* #### `group_similar_strings` 
  Takes a single <samp>Series</samp> of strings (<samp>strings_to_group</samp>) and groups them by assigning to each string one string from <samp>strings_to_group</samp> chosen as the group-representative for each group of similar strings found. (See [tutorials/group_representatives.md](tutorials/group_representatives.md) for details on how the the group-representatives are chosen.)   
  
  If `ignore_index=True`, the output is a <samp>Series</samp> (with the same name as <samp>strings_to_group</samp> prefixed by the string `'group_rep_'`) of the same length and index as <samp>strings_to_group</samp> containing the group-representative strings.  If <samp>strings_to_group</samp> has no name then the name of the returned <samp>Series</samp> is `'group_rep'`.  
   
  For example, an input Series with values: <samp>\['foooo', 'foooob', 'bar'\]</samp> will return <samp>\['foooo', 'foooo', 'bar'\]</samp>.  Here <samp>'foooo'</samp> and <samp>'foooob'</samp> are grouped together into group <samp>'foooo'</samp> because they are found to be similar.  Another example can be found [below](#dedup).
  
   If `ignore_index=False`, the output is a <samp>DataFrame</samp> containing the above output <samp>Series</samp> as one of its columns with the same name.  The remaining column(s) correspond to the index (or index-levels) of <samp>strings_to_group</samp> and contain the index-labels of the group-representatives as values.  These columns have the same names as their counterparts prefixed by the string `'group_rep_'`. 
   
   If <samp>strings_id</samp> is also given, then the IDs from <samp>strings_id</samp> corresponding to the group-representatives are also returned in an additional column (with the same name as <samp>strings_id</samp> prefixed as described above).  If <samp>strings_id</samp> has no name, it is assumed to have the name `'id'` before being prefixed.
   

* #### `compute_pairwise_similarities`
   Returns a <samp>Series</samp> of cosine similarity scores the same length and index as <samp>string_series_1</samp>.  Each score is the cosine similarity between the pair of strings in the same position (row) in the two input <samp>Series</samp>, <samp>string_series_1</samp> and <samp>string_series_2</samp>, as the position of the score in the output <samp>Series</samp>.  This can be seen as an element-wise comparison between the two input <samp>Series</samp>.
   

All functions are built using a class **<samp>StringGrouper</samp>**. This class can be used through pre-defined functions, for example the four high level functions above, as well as using a more interactive approach where matches can be added or removed if needed by calling the **<samp>StringGrouper</samp>** class directly.
   

#### Options:

* #### <a name="kwargs"></a>`kwargs`

   All keyword arguments not mentioned in the function definitions above are used to update the default settings. The following optional arguments can be used:

   * **<samp>ngram_size</samp>**: The amount of characters in each n-gram. Default is <samp>3</samp>.
   * **<samp>regex</samp>**: The regex string used to clean-up the input string. Default is <samp>"[,-./]|\s"</samp>.
   * **<samp>max_n_matches</samp>**: The maximum number of matches allowed per string. Default is <samp>20</samp>.
   * **<samp>min_similarity</samp>**: The minimum cosine similarity for two strings to be considered a match.
    Defaults to <samp>0.8</samp>
   * **<samp>number_of_processes</samp>**: The number of processes used by the cosine similarity calculation. Defaults to
    `number of cores on a machine - 1.`
   * **<samp>ignore_index</samp>**: Determines whether indexes are ignored or not.  If `False` (the default), index-columns will appear in the output, otherwise not.  (See [tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md](tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md) for a demonstration.)
   * **<samp>replace_na</samp>**: For function <samp>match_most_similar</samp>, determines whether `NaN` values in index-columns are replaced or not by index-labels from <samp>duplicates</samp>. Defaults to `False`.  (See [tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md](tutorials/ignore_index_and_replace_na.md) for a demonstration.)
   * **<samp>include_zeroes</samp>**: When <samp>min_similarity</samp> &le; 0, determines whether zero-similarity matches appear in the output.  Defaults to `True`.  (See [tutorials/zero_similarity.md](tutorials/zero_similarity.md) for a demonstration.)
   * **<samp>group_rep</samp>**: For function <samp>group_similar_strings</samp>, determines how group-representatives are chosen.  Allowed values are `'centroid'` (the default) and `'first'`.  See [tutorials/group_representatives.md](tutorials/group_representatives.md) for an explanation.

## Examples

In this section we will cover a few use cases for which string_grouper may be used. We will use the same data set of company names as used in: [Super Fast String Matching in Python](https://bergvca.github.io/2017/10/14/super-fast-string-matching.html).

### Find all matches within a single data set


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from string_grouper import match_strings, match_most_similar, \
	group_similar_strings, compute_pairwise_similarities, \
	StringGrouper
```


```python
company_names = '/media/chris/data/dev/name_matching/data/sec_edgar_company_info.csv'
# We only look at the first 50k as an example:
companies = pd.read_csv(company_names)[0:50000]
# Create all matches:
matches = match_strings(companies['Company Name'])
# Look at only the non-exact matches:
matches[matches['left_Company Name'] != matches['right_Company Name']].head()
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>left_index</th>
      <th>left_Company Name</th>
      <th>similarity</th>
      <th>right_Company Name</th>
      <th>right_index</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>15</th>

      <td>174</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


### Find all matches in between two data sets. 
The <samp>match_strings</samp> function finds similar items between two data sets as well. This can be seen as an inner join between two data sets:


```python
# Create a small set of artificial company names:
duplicates = pd.Series(['S MEDIA GROUP', '012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS', 'foo bar', 'B4UTRADE COM CORP'])
# Create all matches:
matches = match_strings(companies['Company Name'], duplicates)
matches
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>left_index</th>
      <th>left_Company Name</th>
      <th>similarity</th>
      <th>right_side</th>
      <th>right_index</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS LTD</td>
      <td>0.944092</td>
      <td>012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>49777</td>
      <td>B.A.S. MEDIA GROUP</td>
      <td>0.854383</td>
      <td>S MEDIA GROUP</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>49855</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
      <td>1.000000</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>49856</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM INC</td>
      <td>0.810217</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>49857</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE CORP</td>
      <td>0.878276</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


Out of the four company names in <samp>duplicates</samp>, three companies are found in the original company data set. One company is found three times.

### Finding duplicates from a (database extract to) DataFrame where IDs for rows are supplied.

A very common scenario is the case where duplicate records for an entity have been entered into a database. That is, there are two or more records where a name field has slightly different spelling. For example, "A.B. Corporation" and "AB Corporation". Using the optional 'ID' parameter in the <samp>match_strings</samp> function duplicates can be found easily. A [tutorial](tutorials/tutorial_1.md) that steps though the process with an example data set is available.


### For a second data set, find only the most similar match

In the example above, it's possible that multiple matches are found for a single string. Sometimes we just want a string to match with a single most similar string. If there are no similar strings found, the original string should be returned:


```python
# Create a small set of artificial company names:
new_companies = pd.Series(['S MEDIA GROUP', '012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS', 'foo bar', 'B4UTRADE COM CORP'],\
                          name='New Company')
# Create all matches:
matches = match_most_similar(companies['Company Name'], new_companies, ignore_index=True)
# Display the results:
pd.concat([new_companies, matches], axis=1)
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>New Company</th>
      <th>most_similar_Company Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>S MEDIA GROUP</td>
      <td>B.A.S. MEDIA GROUP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS</td>
      <td>012 SMILE.COMMUNICATIONS LTD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>foo bar</td>
      <td>foo bar</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
      <td>B4UTRADE COM CORP</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



### <a name="dedup"></a>Deduplicate a single data set and show items with most duplicates

The <samp>group_similar_strings</samp> function groups strings that are similar using a single linkage clustering algorithm. That is, if item A and item B are similar; and item B and item C are similar; but the similarity between A and C is below the threshold; then all three items are grouped together. 

```python
# Add the grouped strings:
companies['deduplicated_name'] = group_similar_strings(companies['Company Name'],
                                                       ignore_index=True)
# Show items with most duplicates:
companies.groupby('deduplicated_name')['Line Number'].count().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
```

The <samp>group_similar_strings</samp> function also works with IDs: imagine a <samp>DataFrame</samp> (<samp>customers_df</samp>) with the following content:
```python
# Create a small set of artificial customer names:
customers_df = pd.DataFrame(
   [
      ('BB016741P', 'Mega Enterprises Corporation'),
      ('CC082744L', 'Hyper Startup Incorporated'),
      ('AA098762D', 'Hyper Startup Inc.'),
      ('BB099931J', 'Hyper-Startup Inc.'),
      ('HH072982K', 'Hyper Hyper Inc.')
   ],
   columns=('Customer ID', 'Customer Name')
).set_index('Customer ID')
# Display the data:
customers_df
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

      <th>Customer Name</th>
    </tr>

The output of <samp>group_similar_strings</samp> can be directly used as a mapping table:
```python
# Group customers with similar names:

    group_similar_strings(customers_df["Customer Name"])
# Display the mapping table:

Note that here <samp>customers_df</samp> initially had only two columns "Customer ID" and "Customer Name" (before the <samp>group_similar_strings</samp> function call); and it acquired two more columns "group-id" and "name_deduped" after the call.

### <a name="dot"></a>Simply compute the cosine similarities of pairs of strings

Sometimes we have pairs of strings that have already been matched but whose similarity scores need to be computed.  For this purpose we provide the function <samp>compute_pairwise_similarities</samp>:

```python
# Create a small DataFrame of pairs of strings:
pair_s = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        ('Mega Enterprises Corporation', 'Mega Enterprises Corporation'),
        ('Hyper Startup Inc.', 'Hyper Startup Incorporated'),
        ('Hyper Startup Inc.', 'Hyper Startup Inc.'),
        ('Hyper Startup Inc.', 'Hyper-Startup Inc.'),
        ('Hyper Hyper Inc.', 'Hyper Hyper Inc.'),
        ('Mega Enterprises Corporation', 'Mega Enterprises Corp.')
   ],
   columns=('left', 'right')
)
# Display the data:
pair_s
```

## The StringGrouper class

The four functions mentioned above all create a <samp>StringGrouper</samp> object behind the scenes and call different functions on it. The <samp>StringGrouper</samp> class keeps track of all tuples of similar strings and creates the groups out of these. Since matches are often not perfect, a common workflow is to:

1. Create matches
2. Manually inspect the results
3. Add and remove matches where necessary
4. Create groups of similar strings

The <samp>StringGrouper</samp> class allows for this without having to re-calculate the cosine similarity matrix. See below for an example. 


```python
company_names = '/media/chris/data/dev/name_matching/data/sec_edgar_company_info.csv'
companies = pd.read_csv(company_names)
```

1. Create matches


```python
# Create a new StringGrouper
string_grouper = StringGrouper(companies['Company Name'], ignore_index=True)
# Check if the ngram function does what we expect:
string_grouper.n_grams('McDonalds')
```

    ['McD', 'cDo', 'Don', 'ona', 'nal', 'ald', 'lds']


```python
# Now fit the StringGrouper - this will take a while since we are calculating cosine similarities on 600k strings
string_grouper = string_grouper.fit()
```

```python
# Add the grouped strings
companies['deduplicated_name'] = string_grouper.get_groups()
```

Suppose we know that PWC HOLDING CORP and PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP are the same company. StringGrouper will not match these since they are not similar enough. 


```python
companies[companies.deduplicated_name.str.contains('PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP')]
```
